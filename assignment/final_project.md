🎓 Final Project – ML Model Development & Deployment

Due: Friday, March 27, 2026 — 12:00 PM (Africa/Mogadishu / EAT)

---

Part A – Practical Project

Objective:
In this part, you will build a complete ML project of your own choice — from dataset preparation, to training at least two algorithms, to deploying the final model with an API.

---

Instructions

1. Project Setup

Create a GitHub repository for your project.

Organize code into logical folders (dataset/, src/, api/, etc.).

2. Dataset

Use a dataset with at least 1,000 samples.

Document where you got the dataset (Kaggle, UCI, OpenML, self-collected, etc.).

3. Algorithms

Train at least two different algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression & Random Forest, or KMeans & DBSCAN, etc.).

Compare their performance using relevant metrics.

4. Model Evaluation

Show results with metrics and at least 3 sanity checks (sample predictions).

5. Deployment

Expose your trained model as an API (Flask or FastAPI).

Endpoint: /predict must accept JSON input and return predictions.

(Optional, but extra credit): add a simple frontend.

6. Documentation

Write a README.md inside your GitHub repo including:

Project title and description

Dataset details

Algorithms used

Example commands (python train.py, python app.py)

Example API usage with curl

Results summary

7. Paper/Report

Include a project_paper.md or project_paper.pdf in your repo.

Length: 3–5 pages.

Sections must include:

Problem statement & motivation

Dataset & preprocessing

Algorithms and why you chose them

Results & discussion

Deployment notes (API, frontend if included)

Lessons learned

---

Expected Output

A working GitHub repo with:

Training + inference code

Deployed API code

README with instructions

Project paper (Markdown or PDF)


API must run locally and respond correctly to /predict.

---

Part B – Reflection Paper (Inside Repo)

Write a 3–5 page paper covering:

1. Introduction – The problem you solved, why it matters.


2. Dataset – Size, source, features, preprocessing steps.


3. Models – Two algorithms you used, how they work.


4. Results – Metrics + sanity checks. Which performed better?


5. Deployment – How your API works. Example request & response.


6. Lessons Learned – Challenges faced, what you improved, key takeaways.

📤 Submission Format

In the submission portal, create a folder with your own name → final_project/.

Inside it, submit a README.md file containing:

Project title

Short description (2–3 sentences)

Link to your GitHub repository

👉 The full project (code + paper) must be inside the GitHub repo.

---

✅ Evaluation Criteria

Problem choice & definition

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Correct use of at least 2 algorithms

Model evaluation & comparisons

Working API deployment

Documentation (README + paper)

Code quality & commit messages

---

✍️ Explanation:
This assignment is designed as your capstone/defense project.
Instead of being given a dataset and code, you choose the problem, dataset, and approach. The goal is to test your ability to:

Define a real ML problem

Collect & process data

Train & compare algorithms

Deploy a working API

Document your work professionally

By October 10, you will submit only a README.md file with repo link in the portal. The repo itself must contain all project files, code, and paper.
